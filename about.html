        <p>Hi there, I'm Josh Fontecha. I like designing & building things while keeping a growth mindset and having healthy doses of fun.</p>
        <p><u>Currently I'm a front-end design/developer student @Udacity</u></p>
        <p>In the past, I've worked as an IT guy of sorts where I've helped people find creative and effective solutions to problems while staying on budget.</p>
        <p>Some of my constant sources of inspiration, motivation and learning include: Bill Moggridge, Alan Kay, Ivan Sutherland, David Heinemeier Hansson, Charles & Ray Eames, Dieter Rams, Paul Graham, Peter Sellers, Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Alan Moore, Richard Feynman, Elon Musk, Linus Torvalds, Jony Ives, Gary Oldman, Michael Fassbender, Peter Oâ€™Toole, Matthew Weiner, Jean Giraud aka Moebius, Peter Thiel, Larry & Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, Ken Levine, The Coen Brothers, David Fincher, Noah Hawley, John Carmack & Steve Jobs</p>
        <p>Outside of work I spend a lot of time indulging in cinema, reading, writing, running, experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting">intermittent fasting</a> and consuming proper amounts of black coffee, <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/">l-theanine</a> and Club Mate (I have also been known to occasionally splurge on crunchy baguette and good charcuterie in company of fine wine.</p>
        <h4 class="text-center">Why number42 and that triangle logo?</h4>
        <p>I like to think that little triangle as my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(magic)">hypersigil</a>. To me it symbolizes growth and my journey into achieving and fulfilling what I call <a href="http://blog.number42.org/life/advice/2016/05/27/torvalds-law/">"Torvald's law"</a>. As for the number, you probably should read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345391802/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345391802&linkCode=as2&tag=number420d-20&linkId=QSCRKQSPBLSGBRVM">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> to find out why. In a nutshell though, 42 is the answer to the meaning of life in the sense that it's not the answer that is important but rather asking the right questions. Questions like what activities and experience make me happy? Or, has anything I've ever done made my life better? Basically the right questions lead to the right answers: answers you give meaning to. </p>
