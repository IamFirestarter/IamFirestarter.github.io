        <p>Hi there, I'm Josh Fontecha. I like designing, building & writing things. </p>
        <p><u>Currently I'm a front-end design/developer student @Udacity </u></p>
        <p>In the past, I've worked as an IT guy of sorts where I've helped people find creative and effective solutions to problems while staying on budget.</p>
        <p>Some of my constant sources of inspiration, motivation and learning include: David Sandberg (from Kung Fury), Bill Moggridge, Alan Kay, Ivan Sutherland, David Heinemeier Hansson, Charles & Ray Eames, Dieter Rams, Paul Graham, Peter Sellers, Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Alan Moore, Richard Feynman, Elon Musk, Linus Torvalds, Jony Ives, Gary Oldman, Michael Fassbender, Peter Oâ€™Toole, Matthew Weiner, Jean Giraud aka Moebius, Peter Thiel, Devine Lu Linvega, Larry & Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, Ken Levine, The Coen Brothers, David Fincher, Noah Hawley, John Carmack & Steve Jobs</p>
        <p>Outside of work I spend a lot of time indulging in cinema, comics, reading, writing, running, experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting">intermittent fasting</a> and consuming proper amounts of black coffee, <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/">l-theanine</a> and Club Mate (I have also been known to occasionally splurge on crunchy baguette and good charcuterie in company of fine wine.</p>
        <p>One day soon I want to make a movie, publish a videogame and finish that damn novel...</p>
        <h4 class="text-left">Why number42 and that triangle logo?</h4>
        <p>I like to think that little triangle as my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(magic)">hypersigil</a>. To me it symbolizes growth and my journey into achieving and fulfilling what I call <a href="http://blog.number42.org/life/advice/2016/05/27/torvalds-law/">"Torvald's law"</a>. As for the number, you probably should read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345391802/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345391802&linkCode=as2&tag=number420d-20&linkId=QSCRKQSPBLSGBRVM">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> to find out why. In a nutshell though, 42 is the answer to the meaning of life in the sense that it's not the meaning of life that is important, but the meaning we assign it. A lot of people fall into downward spirals they can't ever seem to get out of because they focus too much on trying to find the right answers, when what they should be doing is asking the right questions. Questions like, what fun activities and experiences do I enjoy doing? And how can I spend more time around people that inspire me, and make me laugh and smile? 42 is about asking the right questions which lead to the right answers: answers you and me give meaning and value to. </p>
