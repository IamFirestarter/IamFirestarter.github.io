## problem

Hey,
my name's Ed Tullett and I'm an 18 year old songwriter from England.
I'm not sure who will actually see this email, but I'm basically writing just to say thank you. Your website is an incredible tool for upcoming musicians, and has helped me so much to promote and sell my music. It's wonderfully intuitive, simple and easy-to-use, and is so much better, in my opinion, than sites like Soundcloud and MySpace (which has probably had its last breathe by now!).
My new album, 'Never Joy', was recorded entirely by myself in my bedroom with two microphones and a computer, and Bandcamp has allowed me to show it to a huge audience - it's currently in the top 10 of the Indie, Acoustic, Folk and Singer-Songwriter tags, amongst others, has had over 25,000 plays and 2,000 downloads in the last month, and is above artists that hugely influence me, including Sufjan Stevens, Daughter, etc. I would have never been able to do any of that without Bandcamp, so I owe you guys a lot! I recommend it to any other new bands or artists that I can.
So yeah, I just wanted to say thank you. I've no idea, as I said, who will read this, and I don't know if you've heard my music (it's falsetto/harmony rich acoustic stuff, in the same vein as Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes, Mumford & Sons, etc.), but I'd be honoured if you did and featured me in any of the posts you do, or at least told me what you think!
Anyway, sorry to ramble, the main message is thank you - I'll always owe you guys, and your website, a lot.
Ed.=

Hi Ed! 

Thank you so much for your complements! They mean the world to us! REALLY!

Part of the reason we started Bandcamp was to help artists, LIKE YOU, achieve their dreams. It's messages like these that keep pushing and driving us to come to work everyday and make Bandcamp a better place!

That said, I will be sure to pass on your message to the rest of the Bandcamp team and our founders, so that we keep you in our thoughts for future posts.

cheers,

Wondering why you guys took $30 (5 transactions) away from me for so called "Revinue Sharing"? I don't even make that much on my bandcamp and ive never not got credit for whole sales before. I can't affor for you guys to take entire transactions away and not credit my bandcamp man. Please tell me whats going on. Is there a number I can call.

## response

Hi there John Doe,

I'm very sorry to hear you're having issues. I went ahead and checked your sales report and will try to explain what happened:

The way revenue sharing works is that we send payments later to you in bulk (you can read how that works here https://bandcamp.com/help/sales_report#trackingrevshare). Those 5 transactions you had for $6 each have not been paid out to you because there's a 24hr waiting period for digital items. Your payout should clear out in the next 24hrs (minus fees of course).

We unfortunately do not provide support by phone. You can however reach out to me again if you feel something is not clear.

sincerely,

- Josh @ Bandcamp

## notes

- I went ahead and assumed there's 5 transactions for $6 each that have not been paid out due to the 24hr period. I'd have to check the sales report to verify what really happened of course :)

Hello Band Camp Support,
Why is nothing manifesting? It was 1/21/12 I registered with Band Camp. I checked all the Album covers and mine is not there, in the new Discoverinator,
I think the answer is, how do one drive traffic to a project such as this. Remember, nothing happens without traffic. Is there a recipient of Band Camp that know what they are doing, willing to show me what how they are getting their downloads, if they are. If you don't ask you will never know who you might get to help you.
Could there be a squeeze page, a list, traffic be the missing link? I have been learning how music marketing is done and that's where I am seeing the need for the artist to have that squeeze page, a list and traffic as important tools.
There must be a process through which the music gets to ones smart phone. I know the music I produce is loved by all those who hear it. Why the next step as in downloading so hard to come by.
Talking about the discoverinator, how is that working some one has to know the number group to click the Album cover or is it I am not understanding anything. I do not know I am just asking. I have so much music already composed, just waiting for a break with getting some money to outsource the compositions to have instruments put to the music.
I am asking questions because I am willing to do what ever it takes to get to that point of publishing more music. Thanks, please do not forget me, I am still wondering about a squeeze page.

Sincerely,
Zilla

Hi Zilla! Thanks for reaching out! We did not forget about you!

Here are some tips that might help you get more noticed:

First, make sure you’ve picked your album art. Without album art your music won't appear in search listings, tag listings or Discover. Also remember, that album art will be embedded in your downloads and look great in people’s music collections. You can read how to do that here: https://bandcamp.com/help/design_how_to I'd also encourage you to add a bio image and add recommendations to your profile. 

Another thing you might want to try is asking other musicians (online or offline) for suggestions on how to better market yourself and what strategies they're using to drive sales to their pages.

Now, regarding "squeeze" sections, we do not have any as we believe everyone should have the same opportunities as others to sell their music and get discovered :)

Let me know if there's anything else you need help with!

cheers,

- Josh @ Bandcamp

Hi there
I have just signed up to Bandcamp to release an album, and I would like to release a 3 track version of it (at 96Khz, 24 bit) however the upload limits are not large enough to do this. Any suggestions? The album has been recorded start to finish at 96kHz, and I would like to have an audiophile version available.
Thanks Steve Murrell

## response

Hi Steve! 

Our maximum file size for uploading starts at at 291mb per track. I don't know what file type(s) you're using for each track, but you might want to experiment with different formats (flac, wav, aiff) so that each track does not go over those 291mb. Once you’ve made a few sales through Bandcamp (totaling $20 USD or more), we do increase the max per-track upload size to 600 megs. 

Do be aware though that for some download formats (everything other than FLAC) we’ll need to downsample your consummate originals to 44.1/48 KHz. If you plan on uploading a file with a higher sample rate, be sure to leave at least 0.5 dB of headroom to avoid undesirable clipping in the final transcoded formats.

Let me know if I can be of further help.

cheers,

Josh @ Bandcamp

## problem 

hi.
I signed up eagerly and went to instal the iOS version of the listening app.
My phone is a 3G iPhone.
The iOS is version 4.2(something)
The appstore informed me the app won't work with my iOS !
How on earth can it be too hard to create a listening app that's backwards compatible?
I don't need the frills and jazz of the idiot society, I just want to be able to stream an audio stream, how hard is that ?
Please help.
Best wishes, norman.

## response

Hello there Norman,

So sorry to hear you're having issues downloading our iOS app. I feel your pain. Unfortunately, our iOS app only works with versions of iOS 6 and higher. We can't provide the type of experience you deserve on versions lower than iOS 6. Hope you can understand and forgive us in your heart!

kind regards,

Josh @ Bandcamp

I'm able to log in and look at my home page, yet any time I try to upload new tracks or edit one of my albums, it kicks me back to the login screen. Then, when I log in from there, it just loads the same login screen. What's going on?

## response

Hi there John Doe,

Sorry to hear you're having issues! Have you tried clearing the cache on your web browser? If yes, have you tried any of our troubleshooting tips found here? https://bandcamp.com/troubleshooting

Do let me know if that cache cleaning works out, or if none of those troubleshooting tips work so I can think about what else we can do!

Cheers,

Josh @ Bandcamp
